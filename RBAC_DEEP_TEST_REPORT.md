## Execution Notes
- Static deep audit command: `SKIP_DB=1 node scripts/rbac-deep-audit.cjs`
- API hardening included in this pass:
  - `/api/admin/create-user`: now allows `hr_global_lead` (Admin & HR lead) in addition to `admin/super_admin`.
  - `/api/departments` and `/api/departments/[id]`: create/update/delete now allow `hr_global_lead` in addition to `admin/super_admin`.
