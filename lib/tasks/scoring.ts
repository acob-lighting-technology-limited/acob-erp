/**
 * Weighted task scoring — the single definition of how task work becomes a score.
 *
 * Every task carries a compulsory weight (1-10) and, once approved, a rating
 * (1-5) from its rater. A task is therefore worth `weight` points and earns
 * `weight * rating/5` of them:
 *
 *   weight 5, rating 4/5  →  4 of a possible 5
 *
 * The employee's KPI percentage — 70% of the half-year appraisal — is the sum
 * of what they earned over the sum of what was available. Weight is relative,
 * not a percentage, so a project's weights are deliberately not constrained to
 * total 100: adding a task never forces a rebalance of the existing ones.
 *
 * Both PMS scoring and the project dashboards read from here so a project's
 * quality figure and an employee's KPI can never disagree about the same task.
