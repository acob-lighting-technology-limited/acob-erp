/**
 * Who may do what to an action item.
 *
 * Two different rules, deliberately:
 *
 *  * Content — the directive text, its department, week, timeline and the list of
 *    responsible staff — stays with admins and the lead of the owning department.
 *    That is the same rule the tracker has always used.
 *
 *  * Progress — status and the hindrance note/evidence — follows accountability.
 *    A management directive names the staff held responsible, routinely across
 *    departments, so when names are on it only those people (and admins) may move
 *    it. `department` alone was letting anyone in the stamped department drive a
 *    directive they were never tagged on, while the tagged staff sitting in other
 *    departments could not touch their own.
 *
 * Directives with no names attached fall back to the department rule — that is
 * what "leave empty when the whole department is responsible" means in the form.
