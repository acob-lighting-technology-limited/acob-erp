/**
 * SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for attendance penalty maths.
 *
 * Every consumer — payroll deductions, HR reports, the staff dashboard, the
 * leaderboard and PMS performance scoring — must derive its numbers from
 * `computeAttendanceDay()`. Nothing may re-implement bracket logic locally.
 *
 * Companion single sources (already in place, unchanged by this module):
 *   - `attendance-day-context.ts`  → what *covers* a day (holiday / leave / exemption)
 *   - `attendance-status.ts`       → which *status* a day carries
 *   - this file                    → what that day *costs*, in hours
 *
 * ── The penalty model ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Shift is 08:00–17:00 (9h gross) less a 30-minute lunch ⇒ 8.5h net expected.
 *
 * Late arrival — 08:00–08:20 is grace (0). Thereafter one hour is lost per
 * hour-bracket entered:
 *     08:21–09:00 → -1     09:01–10:00 → -2     10:01–11:00 → -3
 *     11:01–12:00 → -4     …                    16:01–17:00 → -9
 *
 * Early departure — mirrored back from 17:00, with NO grace period:
 *     16:01–17:00 → -1     15:01–16:00 → -2     14:01–15:00 → -3
 *     13:01–14:00 → -4     …                    08:00–09:00 → -9
 *
 * Late and early penalties add together, capped at the 8.5h net day. The worst
 * bracket (-9, i.e. -8.5 once lunch is removed) lands exactly on a full day's
 * loss, so extreme lateness degrades into "absent" naturally rather than
 * needing a separate cutoff rule.
 *
 * Covered days (approved leave, holidays, exemptions, org-wide early closure or
 * late resumption, AWP/LWP/OOS) cost 0 hours and never reach the bracket maths.
