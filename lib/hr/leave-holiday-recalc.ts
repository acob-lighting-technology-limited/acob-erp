/**
 * Re-prices leave that was booked before a public holiday was declared.
 *
 * When HR adds a holiday that lands inside leave someone has already booked,
 * the dates stay exactly as approved and the day is handed back instead: a
 * request that cost 5 days becomes 4, and because entitlement is derived from
 * `leave_requests.days_count` (see lib/hr/leave-entitlement.ts) that refund
 * reaches the employee's balance with no separate balance write.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT done here: pushing the end date out to preserve the original
 * day count. That would silently move an approved return date, invalidating the
 * reliever's coverage and the roster after everyone had already signed off.
 *
 * Only leave that has not started yet is touched. Leave in progress or already
 * taken is left exactly as it was — the days were lived, and rewriting history
 * would desync attendance records that have already been scored.
