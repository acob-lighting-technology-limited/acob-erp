/**
 * Corporate Scorecard attainment — the standard balanced-scorecard rules
 * agreed for this system:
 *
 *   1. Only CORE ownership scores a department. SUPPORT is visible and
 *      taggable but never counted — a department should not be marked down
 *      for a target it merely contributes to.
 *   2. A KPI's attainment is actual ÷ target, not task completion. Tasks are
 *      the evidence trail; the number is the result.
 *   3. Over-achievement is shown in full (a KPI can read 200%) but capped at
 *      100 when it feeds a rollup, so one exceptional result cannot mask
 *      several missed targets.
 *   4. Rollups are equal-weighted averages: KPI → objective → perspective →
 *      company, unless a caller deliberately overrides that.
 *
 * Every function here is pure — no I/O — so the numbers the department page,
 * the register, and the MD rollup show can never disagree about how a
 * percentage was reached.
