-- ============================================
-- Fix Audit Logs RLS Policy for Leads with Empty lead_departments
-- ============================================
-- This migration fixes the audit logs RLS policy to use the lead's own department
-- when lead_departments is empty or null

-- Drop existing audit logs policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "super_admin/admin can view all audit logs" ON audit_logs;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Leads can view their department audit logs" ON audit_logs;

-- Create new policy: Super admin and admin can view all audit logs

  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM profiles
    WHERE profiles.id = auth.uid()
    AND profiles.role IN ('super_admin', 'admin')

-- Create new policy: Leads can view audit logs for their department users
-- Uses lead_departments if available, otherwise uses the lead's own department
