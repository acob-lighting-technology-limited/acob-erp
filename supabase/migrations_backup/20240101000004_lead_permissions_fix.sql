-- Lead Role Permissions Fix
-- ============================================
-- This migration updates RLS policies to ensure leads can only see:
-- 1. Tasks related to their department
-- 2. Documentation related to their department only
-- 3. employee in their lead departments only
-- 4. Devices and assets for their department only
-- 5. Audit logs only for their department and people
-- Leads CANNOT see: Job descriptions, Feedback
